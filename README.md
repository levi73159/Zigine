# Zigine
This is a turtorial based off the Hazel Engine but in zig and modifide 

The vendor/Z libs are from the [zig-gamedev](https://github.com/zig-gamedev/zig-gamedev) repo. but beware I have change some stuff to make it
fit my needs, like adding the onWindowCloseEvent to zglfw, and changing some naming conventions in zgui.
